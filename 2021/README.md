# Advent of Code 2021


My Advent of Code solutions, code, and utilities from 2021. I have written a test suite and made an effort to document my solutions, and clean them up from their midnight-speed-coding state. Some miscellaneous stats about my Advent of Code experience and performance:

- Language: Python 3.10
- IDE: PyCharm
- Packages: `pytest` for unit testing, `numpy` for Day 6's analytical solution.
- 24 / 25 days competing at puzzle unlock. The one that was skipped was due to being on a plane without access to internet.
- Leaderboard Appearances: 15 (9 part 1's, 6 part 2's)
- Total Leaderboard Score: 779 points
- Global Leaderboard Rank: 89th
- Best Leaderboard Rank: Day 14, Part 1 (00:03:25, 16th). This was a swiftly implemented first part that had to be completely thrown out in order to run part two.
- Longest Puzzle: Day 24, at 01:26:21.
- Largest Part 2 Difficulty Spike: Day 22. I managed to read and solve the small region in 00:03:42 (18th), but then took 01:15:53 to implement cube-splitting.
- Favourite puzzle: Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit! I loved the intcode puzzles of 2019 and assembly puzzles of years prior, but this one was fascinating in both how sophisticated the code was, and the reverse engineering experience delivered big. An additional shout-out to Day 8, because the seven segment display was novel, and also led to fun reverse engineering.
