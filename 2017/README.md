# Advent of Code 2017

Advent of Code 2017 completed in [Cordy](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/cordy), a language of my own invention.

Inputs are expected in a folder `/inputs/day##.txt`. Answers (expected output) is expected in `/expected.txt`. Each day can be ran via `make day=##`. All days can be ran with `make test`. The entire set runs in ~three minutes.
