# Advent of Code 2023

This Advent of Code attempting to complete in [Cordy](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/cordy), a language of my own invention. Hopefully not running into any compiler bugs or missing features in the way!

Inputs are expected in a folder `./inputs/dayXX.txt`, and a single day can be ran with `make day=XX`. Expected output of running all days is expected in `./inputs/expected.txt`, and can be tested - including runtime - by running `make test`.
