# Advent of Code 2020

My Advent of Code solutions, code, and utilities from 2020. The project has no dependencies. Inputs are expected in a folder `/inputs/day##.txt`, and running `main.py` will check each day against a csv file of `/inputs/answers.txt`, of the form `part1,part2` for each day (plus one header row).
