# Advent of Code 2016

An exercise in learning Haskell

- [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- VS Code [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justusadam.language-haskell) and [Haskell Lint via GHC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dramforever.vscode-ghc-simple) Extensions.
- [The version of GHC I used because for some dumb reason the official 9.2.5 download does not have working `:doc` and downloading a random binary from a three year old pull request was the only workable solution I could find given every other problem I've had trying to set up this language's impossible toolchain.](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/16415)
