# Advent of Code 2019

 - Total Score: 1054
 - Global Rank: 68th

These are my Advent of Code solutions from 2019. Almost all are written in python, with a couple solved partially by hand or trial and error. The first two days were also solved using Nios II assembly (because why not!)

All my solutions make liberal use of `utils.py`, for input reading or common methods (read: `IntCode`) that were used across many puzzles. I've made an effort to tidy up / improve my initial solutions from their contest winning state.
